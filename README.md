# JPGE
JohnÂ´s Project Game Engine (JPGE) is tiny software based Game Engine writen in Java. It is designed for high performance and based only on the default Java graphics libraries (AWT, SWING...).

**This was my first approach at writing a game engine, I learned a lot but code was bad and buggy. I wanted to build a new one based on my new knowledge and now I'm developing the [JGameEngine](https://github.com/JohnsProject/JGameEngine).**
