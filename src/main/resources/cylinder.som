Wiki : 
 Vertexes contains the vertex data (x, y, z, normal_x, normal_y, normal_z, boneIndex, material) of all visible objects in the scene
 Faces contains the face data (vertex1, vertex2, vertex3, material, uv1_x, uv1_y, uv2_x, uv2_y, uv3_x, uv3_y) of all visible objects in the scene.
 Materials contains the material (red, green, blue, alpha) data of all visible objects in the scene.
 Animations contains the animation data of all visible objects in the scene,
 a animation contains the data of bones at each keyframe and a bone is composed of (px, py, pz, rx, ry, rz, sx, sy, sz),
 where p = position, r = rotation and s = scale.
